# Car Catalog — VitalRP-style template

This repository contains a small car catalog template inspired by the style and vibe of the target site. It is intentionally original and uses placeholder assets.

Quick start:
- Open `index.html` in a browser (or run a simple static server: `python -m http.server` in this folder).
- Replace images in `/images/` with your owned assets (keep filenames or update `script.js`).

How it is organized:
- `index.html` — markup and structure
- `style.css` — theme variables and layout
- `script.js` — sample data and interactivity (search, filter, modal)
- `images/` — placeholder SVG car images

Notes & next steps:
- Swap placeholder images with your real car photos (optimize for web: jpg/webp and sized appropriately).
- If you want pixel-perfect match to a specific page, provide the images and exact fonts and I can iterate further.
